Yelp Dataset Converter


Simple Java programs used to convert the Yelp Dataset Challenge data (round 9) into plain text files separated by a chosen delimiter and splitting the data into lists of JSON objects suitable for importing into CouchDB via curl commands. Just configure the correct directory paths (instead of using my own), and the conversion should work fine.
